Title: A set of convenient functions for working with ADMIXTOOLS
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Martin", "Petr", email = "mp@bodkan.net", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package makes it possible to perform all the stages
    of ADMIXTOOLS analysis without leaving R. A typical ADMIXTOOLS
    workflow usually involves using a combination of sed, awk and manual
    editing to create a set of so called parameter and population files,
    which can be cumbersome especially in case of running many analyses,
    involving different combinations of populations. This package provides
    a convenient set of functions to use the scripting capabilities of R
    to automatically generate the required configuration files from R, as
    well as a set of wrapper function to use those configuration files to
    run ADMIXTOOLS commands. Finally, it makes it possible to parse the
    output files of ADMIXTOOLS programs (which can be somewhat comples and
    full of redundant information), returning to the user a simple
    dataframe of all results, which can be immediately used for plotting
    and running statistical analyses.
