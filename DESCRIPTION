Description: This package makes it possible to perform all the stages of ADMIXTOOLS
    analysis without leaving R. A typical ADMIXTOOLS workflow usually
    involves using a combination of `sed`, `awk` and manual editing to
    create the parameter and population configuration files that specify
    which ADMIXTOOLS command to run and how to run it. Afterwards, the
    user needs to extract the results from an output file (which can be
    somewhat complex and full of redundant information), most likely using
    command-line utilities again, and analyse them in R or Excel. This can
    be cumbersome especially if one wants to run many analyses which test
    different hypotheses that involve various combinations of
    populations. This package provides a set of functions that make it
    easy to automatically generate the required configuration files, as
    well as a set of wrapper functions that run different ADMIXTOOLS
    commands based on these automatically generated configuration
    files. Finally, it provides a simple way to parse ADMIXTOOLS output
    files, extracting only the useful information and returning a simple
    dataframe of all results for immediate plotting and statistical
    analysis.
